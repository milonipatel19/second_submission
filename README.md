# Potable Water Usage By Sector In Canada

Our project team will create a descriptive analytics product which shows potable water usage in Canada by different sectors, the amount of water loss and how the potable water usage has increased over past few years and how can we prepare for future as the population in the country is on rise. Canadians know the importance of our freshwater supply, but by understanding how we use it and where it goes, we can use our supply even more responsibly.
